Wikipedia (Postal Codes)\n* to get neighborhood names for each FSA\n* Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n\n## 3. Neighborhood Profiles\n* to understand neighborhood profiles for Toronto\n* Main source from Canadian Census, but incorporates other data sources as well\n* Source: https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca/download_resource/ef0239b1-832b-4d0b-a1f3-4153e53b189e?format=csv\n\n## 4. Toronto Geospatial Data\n* As geopy is a little unreliable, I would be falling back on the geospatial data provided as part of the course.\n* Source: \"http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data\"\n\nFirst, I will combine sources 2 and 4 to create the geospatial profile of all the neighborhoods in Toronto. Afterwhich, I will add on the neighborhood profile (income levels) from source 3 to complete the picture and narrow down the neighbourhoods to ~1/2 based on income levels. Following which, I will then extract coffee shops/cafes per FSA from the Foursquare API data. This will help me do a k-means clustering of the data, where I can weed out the areas with large numbers of coffee shops and cafes. \n\nFrom there, I can then suggest a few locations for the business owner to set up at. \n"
